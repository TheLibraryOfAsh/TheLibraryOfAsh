# Emoji feature integration test page.

Testing replacement of **::smile:** with :smile:
Did it worked?

Note that the string to use to get this smile is one containing only one **':'** character. The plugin as been tuned as suggested by [DrSlump here](http://juandebravo.com/2012/11/17/emoji-support-in-jekyll/#) to avoid replacing a string by its emoji if it starts with **'::'**.
